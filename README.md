ðŸŽ¥ Video Summarization using Object Detection
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project focuses on automating video summarization using object detection with YOLOv5x, enabling users to quickly analyze long videos and extract meaningful insights. By leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning, the system detects key objects in frames and generates contextual scene summaries that capture the essence of the video.

ðŸ”¬ Key Features

Model: YOLOv5x (largest variant), pre-trained on the COCO dataset (80+ object classes).

Frame Sampling: Processes every 10th frame for an optimal balance between speed and detail.

Contextual Summarization: Analyzes detected objects to infer scene settings (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor, public spaces, nature).

Automated Insights: Generates a descriptive summary of key video scenes, highlighting frequently appearing objects and activities.

Applications: Security monitoring, media archiving, content creation, wildlife tracking, and smart video analytics.
